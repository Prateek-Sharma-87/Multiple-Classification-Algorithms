Loan Classification (whether 'Paid Off' or 'In Collection') is performed using Multiple Classification Algorithms to find the best algorithm for the specific dataset ustilizing various accuracy evaluation methods while tuning the 'Hyperparameters' and visualizing the original data for preprocessing as well as visualising the results

Classification Algorithms Explored: 
1. K Nearest Neighbor (KNN)
2. Decision Tree
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
4. Logistic Regression

Accuracy Evaluation Methods: 
1. Jaccard Similarity Score
2. F-score
3. Log Loss

Visualization Libraries: 
1. Matplotlib
2. Searborn
